    description: I was one of the founding engineers of Resound and designed the system architecture for initial scale. We built a ML-powered audio/video editor in the web, lots of problems related to the efficient transport and playback of large files in the browser. I also worked on an inverse problem, turning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Authoring_Format" target="_blank">AAF files</a> into decision trees of user editing actions.
