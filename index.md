<p>
  Hi there! I am a software engineer and perpetual math student. I graduated from <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/" target="_blank">Florida State University</a> with a mathematics degree in 2020. Since then I have had the pleasure of working on <a href="https://resonaterecordings.com" target="_blank">Resonate Recordings</a> and <a href="https://resound.fm/" target="_blank">Resound.fm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You can visit <a href="/projects">Projects</a> to see what I've contributed to.
