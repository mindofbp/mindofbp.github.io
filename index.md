<p>
  I am an Applied and Computational Math MS student at the <a href="https://amath.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>. I am interested in the combination of computing and mathematics, particularly for simulating physical systems. Prior to UW, I graduated from <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/" target="_blank">Florida State University</a> with a mathematics degree in 2020.

  I have also had the pleasure of working on <a href="https://resonaterecordings.com" target="_blank">Resonate Recordings</a> and <a href="https://resound.fm/" target="_blank">Resound.fm</a>, working to solve problems in audio editing.
