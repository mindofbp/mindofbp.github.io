<p>
  I am an Applied and Computational Math MS student at the <a href="https://amath.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>. Broadly speaking I am interested in the intersection of scientific computing, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations, and subsequent sub-intersections of each. Prior to UW, I graduated from <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/" target="_blank">Florida State University</a> with a mathematics degree in 2020.

  I have also had the pleasure of working on <a href="https://resonaterecordings.com" target="_blank">Resonate Recordings</a> and <a href="https://resound.fm/" target="_blank">Resound.fm</a>, working to solve problems in the audio editing space.
